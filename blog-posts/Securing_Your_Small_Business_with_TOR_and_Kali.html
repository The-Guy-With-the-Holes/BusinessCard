        <li>Understanding the Cyber Threat Landscape:</li>
        <p>Small businesses are not immune to cyber threats. Familiarize yourself with common attack vectors, such as phishing, ransomware, and social engineering, to better assess and mitigate potential risks.</p>

        <li>Establishing a Strong Foundation:</li>
          <i>Employee Training:</i>
          <p>Educate your staff on cybersecurity best practices. Emphasize the importance of strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and following secure protocols.</p>
          <i>Regular Updates and Patches:</i>
          <p>Ensure that all software, including operating systems and applications, is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</p>

        <li>Implementing Network Security Measures:</li>
          <i>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</i>
          <p>Set up firewalls to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Implement an IDS to detect and respond to suspicious activities.</p>
          <i>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</i>
