    Mould Issues

    <h2>
        Our Prior issues with mould:
    </h2>
    <p>
        We have had a lot of issues with mould in our home. It started in the bedroom, where we noticed silk like substances on the walls. At first, we thought it was just spiderwebs, 
        but when we tried to clean it, we realized it was mould. We tried to remove it with bleach, and it seemed to work.
        <br><br>
        Our previous mould cleaner deterimed that the mould originated from the bathroom (which is shares a wall the bedroom) and that the mould was caused by a leak in the bathroom plumbing.
        <br><br>

        <h2>
            Our current mould issues:
        </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mould on exterior roofing garage, front-porch and gutters</li>
    <li>Mould on childrens bedroom window (now cleaned)</li>
    <li>Mould on the bathroom tiles (now cleaned)</li>
</ol>
        <p>
        On the 3rd of June 2024, we noticed the wooden pegs on the clothing line were covered in mould(pictured below).

        Upon searching for the root cause of the mould also noticed a large amount of mould in the garage roofing, where the (sheet)roof was damp to the touch and discoloured (pictured below).

        <p>After further inspection we have found that almost every part of the outer roofing and the gutters are completely covered in mould</p>

        We have not tried to fix the mould on the roof as we are renting the property,and we are worried about damaging the property.
        but it was worth it to protect our health and the health of our family.
