[ FVCK NORMAL ]

[Verse 1]
I'm a hugely successful, dominant, leading, challenging
Passionate, playingful, free flowing, self loving, inspiring badass
It wasn't really a choice that I ever had
But something that was bestowed upon me the day I was born
Waves have come, waves have gone, like any human being
I forgot this at times but right now, right here, as I stand strong
erect, powerful, it is as clear to me as the open blue sky
I've been destined for great things since the day I was born
And now it's my time to keep building towards my kingdom in the sky
I take huge action every day, because the world will know my voice
And the voice of my brothers and my team mates
I constantly bet on and invest in myself and my personal growth
Because when the world knows my voice
They will be moved, to laugh, to love, to grow, to share
To tears, to passion, to action
ALL will hear it, they'll love it, they'll follow it
but they wont follow me
It will move them to follow in their own path
And soon they will encourage the same independence
In their friends, their family, their world
I refuse to cooperate with mediocrity
He is my enemy
and while there isn't much i hope to defeat in this world,
I seethe when I think of the prince of mediocrity
Fuck him!
I commit to myself, my path, my focus, my vision, my world
Lions and sheep were never meant to get along, anyways..
Fuck it!

[Verse 2]
I refuse to let procrastination steal any more time from me
He has taken enough
Because of my mission in life, my time is extremely valuable
It is my most limited asset
And he will never stop taking from those who let him
Fuck him!
You go take from someone else
I commit even deeper right now to bring my vision to reality
To raising my personal value every day
To loving who I'm becoming while loving even more who I am
I commit to all these because the world will speak my name
Because long after I'm gone, my legacy will move mountains
Because my fathers, my father's fathers
My ancestors, my family, my grandparents
Because their greatness lies waiting inside of me, right now
And it's not meant to, it doesn't deserve to
It deserves to be out here, free, like you, like me
Right now, I act now, I move now
My standards for myself are higher now
I want more, I require more, I must
I will have more to give more, I'll always remember
They put a man on the moon!
It may have taken 2 billion dollars, 10 thousand years
And 4 hundred PhDs but they unearthed their challenege
And put a man on the moon
I thank you world for making this time my time
My time - my time - my time - my time...
