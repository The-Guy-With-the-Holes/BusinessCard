<!--

css Standard:
Display inline, up to 48 units, the exception being when the style length begins in the line less than 6 units before line end,

p{background: radial-gradient(circle,#000000da,black,gray);}

which obviously exceeds the 48 unit line, is free to display on the continued -6 block line, or on a new line.

lines should be of similar intent, 

p{color:red; font-size:10px; font-weight:bold;}
